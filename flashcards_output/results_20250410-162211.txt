GitHub Models API Testing Results
================================

Could not access any GitHub Models API endpoints.
To debug, check the samples directory and follow the examples there.

Next steps:
1. Check the 'samples' directory for working examples
2. Use the correct API endpoints and parameters from those samples
3. Try running the samples directly to verify GitHub Models access
